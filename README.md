This is the prokect i worked on during the Kryptosphere / Utopia Hackathon (partnered with nvidia, mistralai, google etc etc)

it's a ai voice agent, as its main tech i used pipcat, pipcat-ai[daily], openai, elevenlabs ad Fastapi 

the voice agent is supposed to act as mentor, you give it a pdf file (whatever size it may be) and you talk to it about it, throughout the convo the ai gauges your level in the subject, and guides you towards what you may need to learn/know
